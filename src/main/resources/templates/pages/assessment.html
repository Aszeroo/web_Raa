                                Learn to protect your information as it is stored, processed, or transmitted. Identify information
                                critical to operations stored on your network. Have plans in place to help recover and restore
                                systems, networks, and data from known good backups. Regular backups protect against ransomware and
                                other forms of malware attacks. Use on-site and remote backup methods to protect vulnerable
                                information. Periodic testing of the organization’s backup and storage procedures ensures continued
                                validity as operational conditions change.

                                Online and cloud storage backup services can help protect against data loss and provide encryption as
                                an added level of security. Identify key files you need access to if online backups are unavailable
                                when you do not have an internet connection.

                                    Domain Name System (DNS) protection blocks dangerous sites and filters out unwanted content. A DNS
                                    look-up service works by translating a URL – a news site for example – to the actual IP address of
                                    that destination. Much like a phonebook that ties a person’s name to their phone number. DNS servers
                                    ensure devices are connecting through a secure portal. This adds a layer of protection against
                                    malware, phishing, and other viruses.

                                    Web browsers represent a common point of entry for malicious attack. Leverage email and web browser
                                    security settings to protect against spoofed or modified emails and unsecured webpages. Content
                                    filtering applied to external websites can prevent attackers from delivering malicious code to
                                    desktop applications. Firewalls can also deny traffic to potentially harmful sites while allowing
                                    access to acceptable applications.
                                    Updating the browsers security settings can make it much harder for malware to get installed. As an
                                    example, settings can be employed to reduce the ability of installing plugins and other add-ons and
                                    to disable certain types of content from automatically executing.

                                        fire or robbery. This involves having incident response plans and procedures, trained staff,
                                        assigned roles and responsibilities, and incident communications plans.

                                        A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based walk through of the incident response plan based on a
                                        simulated emergency described in a particular threat scenario. Team members will discuss their
                                        roles and response to a particular situation or incident that is described in the scenario. This
                                        helps the organization identify flaws or gaps in the organization's response and helps train and

                                        Question Intent: To determine if all staff are trained to recognize cyber threats like Phishing
                                        attacks.
                                        Your staff is often the first line of defense for your organization. Investing in your personnel
                                        reduces vulnerabilities and drives a culture of ownership. They must be equipped to recognize
                                        cybersecurity risks such as phishing scams, password hacks, and outdated anti-malware, as well as
                                        trained to respond and share information appropriately. Regular training helps employees
                                        understand their role in cybersecurity, regardless of technical expertise, and the actions they
                                        take help keep your organization and customers secure.
                                        Training your staff and promoting cyber awareness does not mean you have to create training
                                        materials from scratch. Many professional organizations, industry associations and academic
                                        institutions, as well as private sector and government sources, provide ready-to-use cybersecurity
                                        training resources at no cost.
                                        Training should focus on threats employees encounter, like phishing emails, suspicious events to
                                        watch for, and simple best practices individual employees can adopt to reduce risk. Each aware
                                        employee strengthens your organization against attack, and act as another “sensor” to identify an
                                        attack.

                                        Train personnel about risks like phishing and business email compromise.
                                        Deliver regular updates and reminders to keep everyone aware of current threats and how to handle
                                        them if encountered.
                                        Ensure employees know how and to whom to report suspicious emails, possible phishing attempts and
                                        other anomalous activity.

                                        Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry for attackers. Emails can be
                                        crafted to spoof users into disclosing sensitive information. Using email filtering and malware
                                        scanning at the email gateway reduces the number of malicious emails reaching the organizations
                                        staff. Outbound email can also be filtered to prevent staff from inadvertently sending malicious
                                        email and to alert the organization that there may be an issue internally.

                                            Segmentation divides a computer network into smaller parts. Segmenting a network will improve
                                            network performance and security by reducing the attack surface and limiting how far an attack
                                            can spread. Network traffic can then be controlled between the various parts of the network. A
                                            segmentation policy can be implemented to limit the flow of network traffic by type, source
                                            address, and destination address to name a few.

                                            Some technologies that can be used to implement a segmentation policy include:
                                            firewalls
                                            access control list
                                            virtual local area networks (VLANs)
                                            software defined networks and software defined access technology
                                            <br>

                                            Learn what is happening on your network. Manage network and perimeter components, host and
                                            device components, data at rest and in transit, and user behavior and activities.
                                            Network traffic monitoring can provide organizations visibility into their networks and enable
                                            the organization to build a baseline of normal behavior over time. This baseline of information
                                            will assist the organization in making security-based decisions, finding and tracking malicious
                                            behavior, and in responding to incidents. It will also assist the organization in assessing
                                            network performance issues and application issues.

                                            monitoring—can provide an organization-wide monitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen
                                            attack patterns.

                                                software that is commonly used in a traditional Information Technology (IT) environment.
                                                ICS network architectures typically differ from traditional IT environments and may require
                                                the organization to employ compensating controls. Applying security controls to ICS often rely
                                                on segmentation and boundary control between the IT and OT domains, and careful control design
                                                around local and remote connectivity to reduce attack vectors used to gain access to ICS
                                                networks.

                                                Possible Actions:
                                                <br>
                                                Inventory authorized hardware and software throughout your organization.
                                                Know the physical location and user of the hardware and software to keep patching updates
                                                current. This also allows for any unauthorized hardware or software to be identified and
                                                removed.
                                                Using the inventory, determine and remove all unsupported hardware or software.
                                                Other considerations for ICS:
                                                Obtain a list of recommended and supported hardware and software directly from the ICS
                                                manufactures and vendors.
                                                Evaluate removing unsupported hardware and software. If problematic evaluate adding
                                                compensating controls to protect the environment.
                                                Track end of life and end of support notices and ensure cybersecurity requirements are
                                                considered as part of any future sourcing and procurement processes.

                                                Periodically identify the existence of rouge hardware through monitoring and auditing of
                                                network information systems and comparing against the organization’s inventory.
                                                Quarantine and/or remove all unauthorized (rogue) hardware from the operating environment.

                                                manage the organization’s hardware and software assets.

                                                Implement secure configurations for all hardware and software assets. This will help maintain
                                                the integrity of the assets by ensuring that they can be restored to an acceptable form when
                                                necessary (perhaps after a disruption).
                                                Create and maintain policies and processes that identify and prioritize secure configurations.
                                                Review and implement secure configuration guidance from your vendors and other sources.
                                                Configuration management is a process for managing the integrity of a technology asset over
                                                its lifetime. The resilience of critical services and the assets that support the service may
                                                be affected when the integrity of those assets is compromised.
                                                Configuration Management activities can include:
                                                determining which assets to place under configuration management
                                                identifying the configuration of selected assets
                                                creating configuration baselines
                                                controlling changes to configuration items
                                                maintaining the integrity of baseline configurations
                                                auditing configuration baselines

                                                To determine whether the organization has established configuration baseline images for
                                                hardware and software assets and if those baselines are used to control hardware and software
                                                asset configurations.
                                                Establishing a technology asset baseline (commonly called a configuration item) provides a
                                                foundation for managing the integrity of the asset as it changes over its lifecycle.
                                                Configuration management establishes additional controls over the configuration baseline so
                                                that the asset integrity is maintained and always in a form that is available and authorized

                                                configurations.
                                                Security hardening guides (also referred to as a security configuration checklist, lockdown
                                                guide, security guide, security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) are
                                                documents that:
                                                include instructions or procedures for configuring an IT product to an operational environment
                                                verify that the product has been configured properly
                                                and/or help identify unauthorized configuration changes to the product.
                                                The IT product may be commercial, open source, government-off-the-shelf (GOTS), etc.

                                                securing their systems. Checklists can be developed not only by IT vendors, but also by other

                                                Configuration files that automatically set or verify various security-related settings (e.g.,
                                                executables, security templates that modify settings, Security Content Automation Protocol
                                                (SCAP) XML (Extensible Markup Language) files, and scripts).
                                                Documentation (e.g., text file) that guides the checklist user to manually configure an IT
                                                product
                                                Documents that explain the recommended methods to securely install and configure a device
                                                Policy and programmatic documents that set forth guidelines for such things as auditing,
                                                authentication mechanisms (e.g., passwords), and perimeter security

                                                    Question Intent: To determine if all public facing systems are patched within the prescribed
                                                    timeframe based on guidance and rating (15 days for “Critical” and 30 days for “High”)
                                                    What are patches? Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address
                                                    security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Software vendors may choose to release
                                                    updates to fix performance bugs, as well as to provide enhanced security features.
                                                    When possible, leverage automatic updates for all operating systems and third-party
                                                    software. An easy step is to establish and maintain network security/patching procedures to
                                                    prevent attacks by configuring functions and programs necessary for security. Be sure to
                                                    obtain, test, and deploy the latest versions of operating systems and applications.
                                                    Enabling automatic updates should be done with care. Take the time to determine and
                                                    establish an appropriately architected patching infrastructure and process, and ensure it
                                                    meets the business need. For example, a centralized solution may be best as you do not want
                                                    every system on the network obtaining patches individually from the internet.
                                                    Operational environments may present unique requirements. The security challenges facing
                                                    Industrial Control Systems (ICS) will require additional attention and consideration. It may
                                                    not be possible to employ automated patching methods to all ICS environment assets. It is
                                                    very important that vendor patches be tested in a test environment that closely mimics the
                                                    production environment prior to deploying the patch to the production environment.
                                                    <br>
                                                    A possible software patching process:
                                                    <br>
                                                    1. Plan
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization's inventory of hardware and software assets to help determine which
                                                    patches need to be applied and to help ensure that all applications and devices are kept
                                                    patched.
                                                    Consider using the inventory of assets to group assets by the level of risk and impact they
                                                    would pose to the organization if they were disrupted.
                                                    Consider using the inventory to streamline and consolidate the number of software versions
                                                    in the environment. This will reduce the complexity and overhead of the patching process.
                                                    Establish sources of vendor patching information and track vendor security update
                                                    announcements.
                                                    <br>
                                                    2. Analyze and Test
                                                    <br>
                                                    Analyze the effects of the patch in your environment and determine if you will encounter
                                                    exceptions where a patch can’t be deployed immediately. Until the patch can be applied,
                                                    consider the types of compensating controls you can put in place to protect those assets.
                                                    Establish a test environment and if possible, test the patch before it is deployed to the
                                                    entire environment. Expect bumps in the road.
                                                    Develop a plan for rolling out the patch. If the testing was successful, you may consider
                                                    planning to roll out the patch in a phased approach. Patch a small set of production systems
                                                    to evaluate the effects before rolling it out to the rest of the environment. You may also
                                                    consider multiple phases in your approach.
                                                    A backout plan should also be developed in case there are issues.
                                                    <br>
                                                    3. Implement
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization’s change control process to get approval to implement the patch. Much
                                                    of the information collected above will need to be part of the change request.
                                                    Consider backing up the appropriate assets prior to pushing out the patch.
                                                    Once the change is approved, patch the appropriate assets according to the plan.
                                                    Closely monitor critical assets for issues and implement the backout plan if necessary.
                                                    <br>
                                                    4. Review
                                                    <br>
                                                    Go back and review all the systems that were patched and verify that the patch was applied.
                                                    It is not unusual to find that the patch was unsuccessful on a small percentage of systems
                                                    Reapply the patch to the systems that the patch was unsuccessful for.
                                                    Use any lessons learned to improve the patch process.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Possible considerations:
                                                    <br>
                                                    Enable automatic software updates whenever possible. This will ensure that software updates
                                                    are installed as quickly as possible.
                                                    When possible, do not use unsupported end of life (EOL) software.
                                                    Always visit vendor sites directly rather than clicking on advertisements or email links.
                                                    Avoid software updates while using untrusted networks.
                                                    New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers
                                                    exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep your software up to date. This is one of
                                                    the most effective measures you can take to protect your computer, phone, and other digital
                                                    devices.
                                                    Vulnerabilities are based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
                                                    naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the Common
                                                    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low
                                                    severities correspond to the following scores:
                                                    High: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 7.0–10.0
                                                    Medium: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 4.0–6.9
                                                    Low: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 0.0–3.9

                                                    Question Intent: To determine if all internal-facing systems and firewalls are patched
                                                    within the prescribed timeframe based on guidance and rating (30 days for both Critical” and
                                                    “High”).
                                                    What are patches? Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address
                                                    security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Software vendors may choose to release
                                                    updates to fix performance bugs, as well as to provide enhanced security features.
                                                    When possible, leverage automatic updates for all operating systems and third-party
                                                    software. An easy step is to establish and maintain network security/patching procedures to
                                                    prevent attacks by configuring functions and programs necessary for security. Be sure to
                                                    obtain, test, and deploy the latest versions of operating systems and applications.
                                                    Enabling automatic updates should be done with care. Take the time to determine and
                                                    establish an appropriately architected patching infrastructure and process, and ensure it
                                                    meets the business need. For example, a centralized solution may be best as you do not want
                                                    every system on the network obtaining patches individually from the internet.
                                                    Operational environments may present unique requirements. The security challenges facing
                                                    Industrial Control Systems (ICS) will require additional attention and consideration. It may
                                                    not be possible to employ automated patching methods to all ICS environment assets. It is
                                                    very important that vendor patches be tested in a test environment that closely mimics the
                                                    production environment prior to deploying the patch to the production environment.
                                                    <br>
                                                    A possible software patching process:
                                                    <br>
                                                    1. Plan
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization's inventory of hardware and software assets to help determine which
                                                    patches need to be applied and to help ensure that all applications and devices are kept
                                                    patched.
                                                    Consider using the inventory of assets to group assets by the level of risk and impact they
                                                    would pose to the organization if they were disrupted.
                                                    Consider using the inventory to streamline and consolidate the number of software versions
                                                    in the environment. This will reduce the complexity and overhead of the patching process.
                                                    Establish sources of vendor patching information and track vendor security update
                                                    announcements.
                                                    <br>
                                                    2. Analyze and Test
                                                    <br>
                                                    Analyze the effects of the patch in your environment and determine if you will encounter
                                                    exceptions where a patch can’t be deployed immediately. Until the patch can be applied,
                                                    consider the types of compensating controls you can put in place to protect those assets.
                                                    Establish a test environment and if possible, test the patch before it is deployed to the
                                                    entire environment. Expect bumps in the road.
                                                    Develop a plan for rolling out the patch. If the testing was successful, you may consider
                                                    planning to roll out the patch in a phased approach. Patch a small set of production systems
                                                    to evaluate the effects before rolling it out to the rest of the environment. You may also
                                                    consider multiple phases in your approach.
                                                    A backout plan should also be developed in case there are issues.
                                                    <br>
                                                    3. Implement
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization’s change control process to get approval to implement the patch. Much
                                                    of the information collected above will need to be part of the change request.
                                                    Consider backing up the appropriate assets prior to pushing out the patch.
                                                    Once the change is approved, patch the appropriate assets according to the plan.
                                                    Closely monitor critical assets for issues and implement the backout plan if necessary.

                                                    4. Review
                                                    <br>
                                                    Go back and review all the systems that were patched and verify that the patch was applied.
                                                    It is not unusual to find that the patch was unsuccessful on a small percentage of systems.
                                                    Reapply the patch to the systems that the patch was unsuccessful for.
                                                    Use any lessons learned to improve the patch process.
                                                    Possible considerations:
                                                    <br>
                                                    Enable automatic software updates whenever possible. This will ensure that software updates
                                                    are installed as quickly as possible.
                                                    When possible, do not use unsupported end of life (EOL) software.
                                                    Always visit vendor sites directly rather than clicking on advertisements or email links.
                                                    Avoid software updates while using untrusted networks.
                                                    New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers
                                                    exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep your software up to date. This is one of
                                                    the most effective measure you can take to protect your computer, phone, and other digital
                                                    devices.
                                                    Vulnerabilities are based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
                                                    naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the Common
                                                    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low

                                                    prescribed timeframe based on guidance and rating (15 days for “Critical” and 30 days for
                                                    “High”).
                                                    <br>
                                                    What are patches? Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address
                                                    security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Software vendors may choose to release
                                                    updates to fix performance bugs, as well as to provide enhanced security features.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Make it generally harder for the bad guys by eliminating known vulnerabilities. Obtain,
                                                    test, and deploy software and firmware patches as quickly as practical. Enable automatic
                                                    updates whenever possible. Replace end of life/unsupported operating systems, applications
                                                    and hardware with vendor supported versions/models.
                                                    Enabling automatic updates should be done with care. Take the time to determine and
                                                    establish an appropriately architected patching infrastructure and process, and ensure it
                                                    meets the business need. For example, a centralized solution may be best as you do not want
                                                    every system on the network obtaining patches individually from the internet.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Operational environments may present unique requirements. The security challenges facing
                                                    Industrial Control Systems (ICS) will require additional attention and consideration. It may
                                                    not be possible to employ automated patching methods to all ICS environment assets. It is
                                                    very important that vendor patches be tested in a test environment that closely mimics the
                                                    production environment prior to deploying the patch to the production environment.
                                                    <br>
                                                    A possible software patching process:
                                                    <br>
                                                    1. Plan
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization's inventory of hardware and software assets to help determine which
                                                    patches need to be applied and to help ensure that all applications and devices are kept
                                                    patched.
                                                    Consider using the inventory of assets to group assets by the level of risk and impact they
                                                    would pose to the organization if they were disrupted.
                                                    Consider using the inventory to streamline and consolidate the number of software versions
                                                    in the environment. This will reduce the complexity and overhead of the patching process.
                                                    Establish sources of vendor patching information and track vendor security update
                                                    announcements.
                                                    <br>
                                                    2. Analyze and Test
                                                    <br>
                                                    Analyze the effects of the patch in your environment and determine if you will encounter
                                                    exceptions where a patch can’t be deployed immediately. Until the patch can be applied,
                                                    consider the types of compensating controls you can put in place to protect those assets.
                                                    Establish a test environment and if possible, test the patch before it is deployed to the
                                                    entire environment. Expect bumps in the road.
                                                    Develop a plan for rolling out the patch. If the testing was successful, you may consider
                                                    planning to roll out the patch in a phased approach. Patch a small set of production systems
                                                    to evaluate the effects before rolling it out to the rest of the environment. You may also
                                                    consider multiple phases in your approach.
                                                    A backout plan should also be developed in case there are issues.
                                                    <br>
                                                    3. Implement
                                                    <br>
                                                    Use the organization’s change control process to get approval to implement the patch. Much
                                                    of the information collected above will need to be part of the change request.
                                                    Consider backing up the appropriate assets prior to pushing out the patch.
                                                    Once the change is approved, patch the appropriate assets according to the plan.
                                                    Closely monitor critical assets for issues and implement the backout plan if necessary.
                                                    <br>
                                                    4. Review
                                                    Go back and review all the systems that were patched and verify that the patch was applied.
                                                    It is not unusual to find that the patch was unsuccessful on a small percentage of systems
                                                    Reapply the patch to the systems that the patch was unsuccessful for.
                                                    Use any lessons learned to improve the patch process.
                                                    Possible considerations:
                                                    <br>
                                                    Enable automatic software updates whenever possible. This will ensure that software updates
                                                    are installed as quickly as possible.
                                                    When possible, do not use unsupported end of life (EOL) software.
                                                    Always visit vendor sites directly rather than clicking on advertisements or email links.
                                                    Avoid software updates while using untrusted networks.
                                                    New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers
                                                    exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep your software up to date. This is one of
                                                    the most effective measure you can take to protect your computer, phone, and other digital
                                                    devices.
                                                    Vulnerabilities are based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
                                                    naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the Common
                                                    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low
                                                    severities correspond to the following scores:
                                                    High: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 7.0–10.0
                                                    Medium: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 4.0–6.9
                                                    Low: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 0.0–3.9
                                                    Criteria for “Yes” Response:

                                                    prescribed timeframe based on guidance and rating: 3 days for vulnerabilities rated as

                                                    <br>
                                                    What are patches? Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address
                                                    security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Software vendors may choose to release
                                                    updates to fix performance bugs, as well as to provide enhanced security features.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Make it generally harder for the bad guys by eliminating known vulnerabilities. Obtain,
                                                    test, and deploy software and firmware patches as quickly as practical. Enable automatic
                                                    updates whenever possible. Replace end of life/unsupported operating systems, applications
                                                    and hardware with vendor supported versions/models.
                                                    Enabling automatic updates should be done with care. Take the time to determine and
                                                    establish an appropriately architected patching infrastructure and process, and ensure it
                                                    meets the business need. For example, a centralized solution may be best as you do not want
                                                    every system on the network obtaining patches individually from the internet.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Operational environments may present unique requirements. The security challenges facing
                                                    Industrial Control Systems (ICS) will require additional attention and consideration. It may
                                                    not be possible to employ automated patching methods to all ICS environment assets. It is
                                                    very important that vendor patches be tested in a test environment that closely mimics the
                                                    production environment prior to deploying the patch to the production environment.
                                                    <br>
                                                    A possible software patching process:
                                                    <br>
                                                    1. Plan
                                                    Use the organization's inventory of hardware and software assets to help determine which
                                                    patches need to be applied and to help ensure that all applications and devices are kept
                                                    patched.
                                                    Consider using the inventory of assets to group assets by the level of risk and impact they
                                                    would pose to the organization if they were disrupted.
                                                    Consider using the inventory to streamline and consolidate the number of software versions
                                                    in the environment. This will reduce the complexity and overhead of the patching process.
                                                    Establish sources of vendor patching information and track vendor security update
                                                    announcements.
                                                    2. Analyze and Test
                                                    Analyze the effects of the patch in your environment and determine if you will encounter
                                                    exceptions where a patch can’t be deployed immediately. Until the patch can be applied,
                                                    consider the types of compensating controls you can put in place to protect those assets.
                                                    Establish a test environment and if possible, test the patch before it is deployed to the
                                                    entire environment. Expect bumps in the road.
                                                    Develop a plan for rolling out the patch. If the testing was successful, you may consider
                                                    planning to roll out the patch in a phased approach. Patch a small set of production systems
                                                    to evaluate the effects before rolling it out to the rest of the environment. You may also
                                                    consider multiple phases in your approach.
                                                    A backout plan should also be developed in case there are issues.
                                                    3. Implement
                                                    Use the organization’s change control process to get approval to implement the patch. Much
                                                    of the information collected above will need to be part of the change request.
                                                    Consider backing up the appropriate assets prior to pushing out the patch.
                                                    Once the change is approved, patch the appropriate assets according to the plan.
                                                    Closely monitor critical assets for issues and implement the backout plan if necessary.
                                                    4. Review
                                                    Go back and review all the systems that were patched and verify that the patch was applied.
                                                    It is not unusual to find that the patch was unsuccessful on a small percentage of systems
                                                    Reapply the patch to the systems that the patch was unsuccessful for.

                                                    Enable automatic software updates whenever possible. This will ensure that software updates
                                                    are installed as quickly as possible.
                                                    When possible, do not use unsupported end of life (EOL) software.
                                                    Always visit vendor sites directly rather than clicking on advertisements or email links.
                                                    Avoid software updates while using untrusted networks.
                                                    New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers
                                                    exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep your software up to date. This is one of
                                                    the most effective measure you can take to protect your computer, phone, and other digital
                                                    devices.
                                                    Vulnerabilities are based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
                                                    naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the Common
                                                    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low
                                                    severities correspond to the following scores:
                                                    High: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 7.0–10.0
                                                    Medium: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 4.0–6.9
                                                    Low: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 0.0–3.9

                                            responsibilities. Test it often. Incident response plans and disaster recovery plans are crucial
                                            to information security, but they are separate plans. Incident response mainly focuses on
                                            information asset protection, while disaster recovery plans focus on business continuity.
                                            Once you develop a plan, test the plan using realistic simulations (known as “war-gaming”),
                                            where roles and responsibilities are assigned to the people who manage cyber incident
                                            responses. This ensures that your plan is effective and that you have the appropriate people
                                            involved in the plan. Disaster recovery plans minimize recovery time by efficiently recovering
                                            critical systems.

                                            Plan, prepare, and conduct drills for cyber-attacks and incidents as you would a fire or
                                            robbery. Make your reaction to cyber incidents or system outages an extension of your other
                                            business contingency plans. This involves having incident response plans and procedures,
                                            trained staff, assigned roles and responsibilities, and incident communications plans.

                                                        Passwords are the most common means of authentication, but only work if they are complex
                                                        and confidential. Many cyber-attacks occur due to weak and easy-to-guess passwords, so all
                                                        passwords should be strong and unique, such as a sentence with numeric and non-numeric
                                                        digits. Although intentionally misspelling a word ("daytt" instead of "date") may offer
                                                        some protection against specific types of attacks (e.g. dictionary attacks) an even better
                                                        method is to rely on a series of words and use memory techniques, or mnemonics, to help
                                                        you remember how to decode it. Some hackers are more sophisticated and use algorithms to
                                                        figure out passwords, so consider mechanisms that are stronger than password
                                                        authentication such as biometrics, one-time passwords, and tokens for sensitive
                                                        applications and functions.
                                                        The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed specific
                                                        guidelines for strong passwords. According to NIST guidance, you should consider using the
                                                        longest password or passphrase permissible (8–64 characters) when you can. For example,
                                                        "Pattern2baseball#4mYmiemale!" would be a strong password because it has 28 characters and
                                                        includes the upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

                                                        Use multi-factor authentication when available.
                                                        Use different passwords on different systems and accounts.
                                                        Don't use passwords that are based on personal information that can be easily accessed or
                                                        guessed.
                                                        Use the longest password or passphrase permissible by each password system.
                                                        Don't use words that can be found in any dictionary of any language.
                                                        Develop mnemonics to remember complex passwords.
                                                        Consider using a password manager program to protect and keep track of your passwords.

                                                        Multi-factor authentication (MFA), sometimes referred to as two-factor authentication or
                                                        2FA, is a security enhancement that allows you to present two pieces of evidence – your
                                                        credentials – when logging in to an account. Your credentials fall into any of these three
                                                        categories: something you know (like a password or PIN), something you have (like a smart
                                                        card), or something you are (like your fingerprint). Your credentials must come from two
                                                        different categories to enhance security – so entering two different passwords would not
                                                        be considered multi-factor.

                                                        Multi-factor authentication (MFA), sometimes referred to as two-factor authentication or
                                                        2FA, is a security enhancement that allows you to present two pieces of evidence – your
                                                        credentials – when logging in to an account. Your credentials fall into any of these three
                                                        categories: something you know (like a password or PIN), something you have (like a smart

                                                        different categories to enhance security – so entering two different passwords would not
                                                        be considered multi-factor.

                                                        MFA is quite simple, and organizations are focusing more than ever on creating a smooth

                                                        logged into a website that sent a numeric code to your phone, which you then entered to
                                                        gain access to your account.

                                                        policies and procedure to control user access.
                                                        Least privilege is the restriction of privileges to only those accounts that require them
                                                        to perform their duties, while limiting accounts to only those privileges that are truly
                                                        necessary. Doing this reduces the exposure of those privileges to a smaller, more easily
                                                        manageable set of accounts. Local administrative accounts and accounts for software
                                                        program management and installation are particularly powerful, but have small scopes of
                                                        control and should be restricted as much as possible.
                                                        Grant access and admin permissions based on the principles of need-to-know and least

                                                        <br>
                                                        Are you asking why someone, or something, needs privileged access?
                                                        Does the marketing team need access to the company’s financial transactions?
                                                        Does the reservations team need access to social media sites?
                                                        Does a junior analyst need management-level admin / configuration privileges?
                                                        Answering these questions helps you identify and implement need-to-know and least
                                                        privilege to lower the risks of malware infections, data breaches, and insider threats.

                                                        Question Intent: To determine if the principle of least privilege is enforced through
                                                        technical means to control user access.
                                                        Least privilege is the restriction of privileges to only those accounts that require them
                                                        to perform their duties, while limiting accounts to only those privileges that are truly
                                                        necessary. Doing this reduces the exposure of those privileges to a smaller, more easily
                                                        manageable set of accounts. Local administrative accounts and accounts for software
                                                        program management and installation are particularly powerful, but have small scopes of
                                                        control and should be restricted as much as possible.
                                                        Grant access and admin permissions based on the principles of need-to-know and least
                                                        privilege. Restrict user access to only the information, networks, hardware, and
                                                        applications necessary.

                                                        Questions to consider:
                                                        Are you asking why someone, or something, needs privileged access?
                                                        Does the marketing team need access to the company’s financial transactions?
                                                        Does the reservations team need access to social media sites?
                                                        Does a junior analyst need management-level admin/ configuration privileges?
                                                        Answering these questions helps you identify and implement need-to-know and least
                                                        privilege to lower the risks of malware infections, data breaches, and insider threats.

                                                        Technical implementations of least privilege can include:
                                                        Assigning users to specific groups with certain privileges applied
                                                        Assigning user working hours
                                                        Using machine-based restrictions
                                                        Employing separate processing domains for finer grain allocation of user privileges
                                                        Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles
                                                        Using location-based restrictions

                                                        An audit log is a record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and
                                                        networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a
                                                        specific event that has occurred within a system or network. Many logs within an
                                                        organization contain records related to computer security. These computer security logs
                                                        are generated by many sources, including security software, such as antivirus software,
                                                        firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems; operating systems on servers,

                                                        To determine the set of auditable events, organizations should consider the auditing
                                                        appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented.
                                                        To ensure that the current set of auditable events is still appropriate, a periodic review
                                                        should be performed.
                                                        Information system audit records should be periodically (as defined by the organization)
                                                        reviewed for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity.
                                                        Audit information and audit tools should be protected from unauthorized access,
                                                        modification, and deletion.
                                                        Organizations should retain audit records until it is determined that they are no longer
                                                        needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other purposes.

                                                        conducted.
                                                        Users should be made aware of policies and procedures regarding appropriate use of
                                                        networks, systems, and applications. Applicable lessons learned from previous incidents
                                                        should also be shared with users so they can see how their actions could affect the

                                                        incidents. IT staff should be trained so that they can maintain their networks, systems,

                                                        Organizations should determine the appropriate content of security training based on the

                                                        networks is developed. The policy should, at a minimum, indicate that adding unauthorized

                                                        The policy should also direct that awareness training be developed to train users of the
                                                        issues surrounding the addition of unauthorized or rogue hardware to the organizations

                                                            software (an “allowlist”)
                                                            An application allowlist is a list of applications and application components
                                                            (libraries, configuration files, etc.) that are authorized to be present or active on a
                                                            host. Application allowlists, in conjunction with application allowlisting technologies,
                                                            are used to stop the execution of malware and other unauthorized software. Application
                                                            allowlist technologies are designed to permit only known good activity and block all
                                                            other.
                                                            Application allowlisting can be more effective at stopping unknown malware threats than
                                                            conventional antivirus software and other traditional antimalware security controls.
                                                            Allowlisting can be implemented using a combination of commercial tools, policies, or
                                                            application execution tools. Features that implement allowlists are included in many
                                                            modern endpoint security suites and other technologies.

                                                    on business continuity. Once you develop a plan, test the plan using realistic simulations
